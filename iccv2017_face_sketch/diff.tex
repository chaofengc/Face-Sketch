Quantitative and qualitative evaluations suggest that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-arts methods. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In addition, despite of the small training data (}\red[??] \DIFadd{face-sketch pairs), our model shows great generalization ability across different datasets and can generate reasonable results under practical situations.

\DIFaddend Face sketch synthesis has drawn a great attention from the community in recent years because of its wide range of applications. For instance, it can be exploited in law enforcement for identifying suspects from a mug shot database consisting of both photos and sketches. Besides, face sketch has also been widely used for entertainment purpose. For example, filmmakers could employ face sketch synthesis technique to ease the cartoon production process.

\DIFaddend Unfortunately, there exists no easy solution to face sketch synthesis due to the big stylistic gap between photos and sketches. In the past two decades, a number of exemplar based methods~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2009face,zhang2010lighting,zhou2012markov} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2009face,song2014real, zhang2010lighting,zhou2012markov} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend were proposed. In these methods, an input photo is divided into patches and candidate sketches for each photo patch are selected from a training set. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sketch output of a photo patch can be represented by either the best candidate or a linear combination of the best $K$ candidate sketch patches. However, processing each photo patch individually often introduces }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{main drawback of such kind of methods is that if the test image can't find a similar patch in the training set, they may lose some contents in the final result. For example, the sketches in the first row of Fig.\ref{fig:example_comp} fail to keep the hairpins. Besides, some methods \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{song2014real,zhou2012markov} }%DIFAUXCMD
clear away the textures when they try to eliminate the }\DIFaddend inconsistency between neighboring patches. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To tackle this problem, methods in ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2009face,zhang2010lighting,zhou2012markov} }%DIFAUXCMD
adopted Markov Random Fields (MRF)to regularize the synthesis process}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another potential risk is that the result may not look like the original photo, }\eg \DIFadd{left eye in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_comp} (b)}\DIFaddend . Recently, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an image based approach~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{song2014real} }%DIFAUXCMD
based on the idea of joint image filtering was proposed. It was found superior in suppressing noises in the sketch. Another recent approach based on a feed-forward }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approaches \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zhang2017content,zhang2015end} }%DIFAUXCMD
based on }\DIFaddend convolutional neural network (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{FCNN) was found to be more effective in generating discriminative facial details~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zhang2015end}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Although sketches produced by these methods do look like the faces in the photos, they look quit different from sketches drawn by real artists.One major }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CNN) were developed to solve these problems. Since these models directly generates sketches from photo, they can maintain the structures and contents of the photos. However, the loss function of them are usually mean square error (MSE) or variation of it, which is responsible for the blur effect, }\eg \DIFadd{Fig.~\ref{fig:example_comp} (e) and (f). The }\DIFaddend reason is that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these methods do not consider the style of the synthesized sketches. For example, the hair in their synthesized sketches is often lack of texture, and the region around the face boarders often suffers from blurring artifacts (see Fig. ~\ref{fig:example_comp} ). Besides, both the exemplar based and image based approaches cannot handle structures that do not exist in the training set (e. g., clothes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MSE prefers values close to mean, and is not suitable for texture representations. The popular neural style transfer provides a better solution for texture synthesis. But there are two obstacles towards directly applying such kind of method. First, it is easily influenced by illumination of the photo, see the face of Fig. \ref{fig:example_comp} (h). Second, it needs a style image to give the global statistics of textures. If the given style doesn't coincide with target sketch (which we don't have), some side effects will occur, }\eg \DIFadd{the nose }\DIFaddend in Fig. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~\ref{fig:example_comp} ).}%DIFDELCMD < \par

\DIFaddend For an artist, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{instead of drawing sketches region by region, }\DIFdelend the procedure of sketching a face usually starts with outlining the shape of the key facial features like the nose, eyes and mouth. Textures and shadings are then added to regions such as hair lips, and bridge of the nose to give sketches a specific style. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Inspired by this and neural style transfer \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{gatys2015texture}}%DIFAUXCMD
, we propose a new framework for face sketch synthesis that can overcome the aforementioned limitations. }\DIFaddend In our method, the outline of a face is delineated by a feed-forward neural network, and textures and shadings are then added by a style transfer approach. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We formulate the style as a statistical measure of the features extracted from multiple resolutions of the sketches using the VGG-Network~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{simonyan2014very}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Due to the non-linearity of these features and the fact that there usually does not exist a training photo that is very similar to the test photo, estimating the style for a target sketch is not easy. In spired by the work of Wang and Tang~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

and convolution layers with batch normalization~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Sergey2015batch} }%DIFAUXCMD
to outline the face (Section ~}\red[??]\DIFadd{). For the texture part, we first }\DIFaddend divide the feature maps of the target sketch \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{into a grid and use the features of a candidate sketch patch as a surrogate for the feature map patch of a grid cell}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in each layer into a fixed size grid and combine features from different layers but at the same grid location into a pyramid feature column (Section ~}\red[??]\DIFadd{).

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < }

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Based on the taxonomy of previous studies~\cite{song2014real,zhou2012markov}, face sketch synthesis methods can be roughly categorized into profile sketch synthesis methods~\cite{berger2013style,chen2001example,xu2008hierarchical} and shading sketch synthesis methods~\cite{liu2005nonlinear,song2014real,tang2003face,wang2009face,zhang2015end,zhang2010lighting,zhou2012markov}. Compared with profile sketches, shading sketches are more expressive and thus more preferable in practice. Based on the assumption that there exists a linear transformation between a face photo and a face sketch, the method in~\cite{tang2003face} computes a global eigen-transformation for synthesizing face sketches from face photos. This assumption, however, does not always hold since the modality of face photos and that of face sketches are quite different. Fortunately, Liu et al.~\cite{liu2005nonlinear} found that the linear transformation holds better locally and therefore they proposed a patch based method to perform sketch synthesis. A MRF based method~\cite{wang2009face} was proposed to preserve large scale structures across sketch patches. Variants of the MRF based methods were introduced in~\cite{zhang2010lighting,zhou2012markov} to improve the robustness to lighting and pose, and to render the ability of generating new sketch patches. In addition to these MRF based methods, approaches based on guided image filtering~\cite{song2014real} and feed-forward convolutional neural network~\cite{zhang2015end} are also found to be effective in transferring photos into sketches. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {

\subsection{\DIFadd{Style Transfer with CNN}}

\DIFadd{Texture synthesis has long been a challenging task. Traditional method can only imitate repetitive patterns which has a strong limitation. Recently, Gatys }\etal \DIFaddend ~\cite{gatys2015texture,gatys2015neural}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Gatys et al. }\DIFdelend studied the use of CNN in style representation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(including texture and color) }\DIFaddend where a target style is computed based on features extracted from an image using the VGG-Network and an output image is generated by minimizing the difference between its style and the target style. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Likewise, a perceptual loss function measuring the difference in style between a targeting image and images generated from a CNN was proposed in ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{feifei2016} }%DIFAUXCMD
and it was then exploited in the CNN training stage. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It can transfer any style to any images, and the results are impressive. Justin }\etal \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{feifei2016} }%DIFAUXCMD
further accelerated this process by learning a feed forward CNN in the training stage. These methods represent textures by a multi-scale gram matrix of feature maps. Since gram matrix cares more about global statistics, if the style is very different from the photo, it usually breaks the local structures. Although it is not a big deal in artistic style, it can't be tolerated in face sketch synthesis. In \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Chen2016Patch}}%DIFAUXCMD
, Chen and Schmidt propose a different patch based style transfer method which is better at capture local structures. However, it is still not suitable for this task. }\DIFaddend Our style transfer mechanism is inspired by but different from these works~\cite{gatys2015texture,gatys2015neural,feifei2016} in that our target style is extracted from many \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{images }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{image patches }\DIFaddend rather than from a single style image. Note that there usually does not exist a single style image in the training set that matches all properties of the test image. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hence, we propose computing the target style based on multiple images. The difficulty of generating a target style from multiple images lies in the non-linearity of the neural network. %DIF < -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\DIFadd{Motivation of Pyramid Feature Column}}

\DIFadd{Following the practice of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{gatys2015neural}}%DIFAUXCMD
, we use the gram matrix of VGG-19\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{simonyan2014very} }%DIFAUXCMD
feature maps as our style representation. Denote the vectorized feature map of the final sketch $\mathcal{X}$ in the $l$th layer by $F^{l}(\mathcal{X})$. A gram matrix is the inner product between the feature maps in $l$th layer
}\begin{equation}
\DIFadd{G^l_{ij}(\mathcal{X}) = \sum \limits_{k=1}^{M_l} F^l_{ik}(\mathcal{X}) F^l_{jk}(\mathcal{X})
\label{eq:Gram_element}
}\end{equation}
\DIFadd{where $G^l(\mathcal{X}) \in {\mathcal{R}^{N_l \times N_l}}$, $M_l$ is the height times width of the feature map $F^{l}(\mathcal{X})$, and $N_l$ is the number of feature maps in the $l$th layer. Since $G^l_{ij}(\mathcal{X})$ is an inner product of feature maps, a gram matrix is actually a summary statistics of feature maps discarding the spatial information. Although we still not clear what these values exactly mean, we can safely make an assumption that it at least captures the density distribution of a sketch. In other word, if the given sketch style has much less hair than the test image, the generated sketch $\mathcal{X}$ will possibly be unnaturally bright than a natural sketch. Experiments in Section~}\red[??] \DIFadd{also prove this. 
Thus it is important to keep the given style sketch roughly the same with test image statistically. On the other hand, there usually does not exist a candidate image in the training set that perfectly matches a given test photo in style. We hence propose a feature level patch based method to estimate the style of the final sketch. Each feature patch corresponds to a sketch patch. The reason why we can separate features into patches comes from \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Li2017Demistify}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The feature vectors at different position of feature map can be viewed as independent samples when we use gram matrix.

\DIFaddend Our method can be classified as a shading synthesis method. The steps of our method are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}. First, a preprocessing step as described in~\cite{wang2009face} is carried out for all photos and sketches in a training set to align the centers of two eyes. A test photo $\mathcal{I}$ is then fed into two branches, namely the content network and the style generator\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, respectively}\DIFdelend . The content network converts the test photo into a content image $\mathcal{C}$, where \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{facial features and }\DIFdelend the shape of the face are outlined with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{global arrangement of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{key }\DIFaddend facial features preserved\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Loss Function}}
\DIFaddend }
To generate a sketch that combines the content image with the estimated style, we adopt the methodology described in~\cite{gatys2015texture}. Specifically, we minimize a loss function consisting of a style loss, a content loss and a component loss. The style loss is defined as the difference between the gram matrix of the final sketch and the target gram matrix i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{s} autoref( \mathcal{X} ) = \sum\limits_{l \in {L_s}} {\frac{1}{{M_l^2N_l^2}}autoref\| {{G^l}autoref( \mathcal{X} ) - G_t^l} \|_2^2} 
\label{eq:Gram_loss}
\end{equation}
where $N_l$ denotes the number pixels in the feature map at layer $l$. The content loss is defined based on the difference between the feature map of the sketch and that of the content image at layer conv1\_1:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{c}autoref( \mathcal{X} ) = autoref\| {{F^{\rm{conv1\_1}}}autoref( \mathcal{X} ) - {F^{\rm{conv1\_1}}}autoref( \mathcal{C} )} \|_2^2.
\label{eq:Style_loss}
\end{equation}
Human is able to distinguish different people from key components such as eyes, nose and mouth, which indicates that these features are the most discriminative parts of a face. Specific styles or textures are usually used to emphasize these components, for example, sharp edges with shadings at the two sides of the nose are used to convey 3D information. To better transfer styles of these components, we employ a component loss to encourage the key component style of the final sketch being the same as the target key component style. Since two eyes are placed at fixed positions, the key components lie roughly within a rectangular region taking the positions of two eyes as vertices. Key component style is given by gram matrices calculated within feature map regions $\mathcal R$ corresponding to the key components. These regions are specified by hyper-grid cells $U_{ij}$ whose $C_{ij}$ are inside the rectangular region. More specifically, a target style for the key component is calculated: \{${\hat G}_{t}^l ={A}_{c}^l \cdot {autoref( {{{A}_{c}^l}} )^T}$\} where ${A}_{c}^l$ is the composed feature map patch in $A^{l}$ corresponding to the key components, $l\in L_s$. The style of the key components in final sketch ${\hat G}^lautoref( \mathcal{X} ) $ is calculated in exactly the same manner. The component loss is hence defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{k} autoref( \mathcal{X} ) = \sum\limits_{l \in {L_s}} {\frac{1}{{M_l^2{\hat N}_l^2}}autoref\| {{{\hat G}^l}autoref( \mathcal{X} ) - {\hat G}_t^l} \|_2^2} 
\label{eq:component_loss}
\end{equation}
where ${\hat N}_l$ denotes the number of pixels in the feature map region $\mathcal R$ at layer $l$. The total loss we minimize is 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{t}autoref( \mathcal{X} ) = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{c} + \beta_1 \mathcal{L}_{s} + \beta_2 \mathcal{L}_{k}
\label{eq:Total_loss}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the weighting factors for content, style and component losses respectively. The minimization is carried out using L-BFGS. Instead of using random noises, we use the content image as a starting point, which will make the optimization process converge much faster.

\DIFdel{In all experiments, we resize test photos and photo-sketch pairs in the training set to a fixed size of $288\times288$.

Since generating the final sketch involves an iterative optimization process, the gradient of the final sketch with respect to the content image is not easy to calculate, which prohibits training the content network in an end-to-end manner.

\cite{song2014real,wang2009face,zhang2015end,zhou2012markov}}%DIFAUXCMD
. If an algorithm achieves higher sketch recognition rates, it suggests that this method is more effective in synthesizing sketches. We adopt the widely used PCA based recognition method with ``rank-1 (R1)'', ``rank-5 (R5)'' and ``rank-10 (R10)'' criteria ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2009face} }%DIFAUXCMD
where ``rank $n$'' measures the rate of the correct answer in the top $n$ best matches. The results of different methods are shown in Table~\ref{tab:reg_percentage}. Our method achieves the best performance against all other methods in the ``R1'' and ``R5'' tests. There may be two reasons behind this. First, since the test photos are different from those in the training set, we do not expect to find suitable patches from the training set for the target patches. The remedy of linearly combining the patches as in~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zhou2012markov} }%DIFAUXCMD
will introduce over smoothing and blurring artifacts, which are also observed in the filtering like approach~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{song2014real}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Being a generative model, the content network learns the modality transformation locally between photos and sketches, such as transferring edges in photos to strokes in sketches. This helps generating sketches for structures not existing in the training set. Second, our model explicitly minimizes the difference by the style between the synthesized sketches and sketches drawn by artists, while this difference is ignored by all other methods. The performance of all methods in the ``R10'' test are fairly the same.

\DIFadd{W^{k} = W^{k}_r+W^{k}_g+W^{k}_b

The smaller the NGMD value is, the more similar $\mathcal{X}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W^{k}_r$, $W^{k}_g$, }\DIFaddend and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{${\tilde {\mathcal{X}}}$ are. Thanks to our style transfer, our results have the smallest NGMD value among all methods under test (see Table 2). It is therefore obvious that our results are the closest to the sketches drawn by artists. 
Qualitative evaluation results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:q_eval_1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:q_eval_2}, where we find that our method provides much clear boundaries and better texture in regions containing hairs and shadings. The results of~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zhang2015end} }%DIFAUXCMD
can roughly outline the sketches, but they do not look like sketches in style. This is also indicated by a high NGMD in Table~\ref{tab:NGMD}. The results of MRF~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wang2009face} }%DIFAUXCMD
and WMRF~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zhou2012markov} }%DIFAUXCMD
are more similar to hand drawn sketches in style since these exemplar based approaches use patches of hand drawn sketches to make up the target sketch.
That is why they have a smaller NGMD value. Inheriting the ability of denoising, the filtering based approach~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{song2014real} }%DIFAUXCMD
is good at suppressing noises in the results. However, it is also likely for this method to over-smooth the results, which will deteriorate the texture and even introduce blurring artifacts.

\DIFdel{The loss function we minimize during the generation of sketches contains three terms for content, style and key components respectively.

components (see Fig.~\ref{fig:region_effect}) . To better understand how style influences the final sketch, we smoothly change the emphasis on style by adjusting $\beta_1$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W^{k}_b$ are weights of the $k$th filter in the first convolutional layer for the R, G and B channels respectively, }\DIFaddend and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\beta_2$ while keeping $\alpha$  fixed. Fig.~\ref{fig:alphg_effect} indicates that the sketch with style transfered contains more texture and is more like a drawn sketch. The Theano implementation of the proposed method takes approximately $100$ seconds to generate a sketch on a GeForce GTX TITAN X platform. The bottle neck lies in the style transfer which requires feeding $\mathcal{X}$ to the VGG-Network to estimate targeting feature maps and to calculate the gradient of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Total_loss}) , which is computationally intensive.
